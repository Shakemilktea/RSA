# RSA
This is my RSA code.

This code also compares how much the decryption speed of RSA improves after using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).

There is also a faster_CRT_RSA code, but this part is not yet complete.

Because there appear to be some mathematical errors in the calculations of faster_CRT_RSA in the paper.
